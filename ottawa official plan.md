Questions:
- Does this plan inform zoning? Much of the city is covered in R1, limiting the intensification
    - Zoning is seperate, soming later from another team
- Where can we find the recordings?
     - They'll be transcribed for the webpage. Available next week [[2021-07-05_Mon]] 
- Will the monitoring dashboard be public?
