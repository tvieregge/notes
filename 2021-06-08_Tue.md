TODO:
- [ ] [[golden path documentation]] discussion (or not...)
    - [[onboarding for fast growth]] also has useful info
- [x] work on [[miso dart]] dedupe stuff

Maybe use one of those things that shows they key you press on screen?

#### Slack
- how much information does the take-home at the end of interviewing give us?
    - how man times have we gone from hire -> no-hire or vice versa?
    
#### Team meetings
- teams getting splintered https://github.com/voltusdev/voltus/discussions/8543
- voltlet onboarding project: always a bid idea unless we've got a voltlet team?
- How do we follow up on discussion? We have some good ones that fizzle out
- formalize 1 on 1 meeting with team for new hires?
    
#### [[max]] 1:1
[[max]]
- wtf is the Voc admin sms backend?

[[miso dart]] sends duplicate messages with different timestamps as well as duplicate intervals
