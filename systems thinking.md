Model systems with accumulations (*stocks*) and changes to those accumulations (*flows*)

> The fundamental observation of systems thinking is that the links between events are often more subtle than they appear. We want to describe events causally–our managers are too busy because we’re trying to ship our current project–but few events occur in a vacuum... perhaps the managers are busy because no one hired and trained the managers required to support this year’s project deadlines

In this example a stock might be the number of trained managers, while a flow (either an *inflow* or *outflow*) couls be the training rate. In the following diagram circles are stocks and lines are flows, whith the dashed line representing a *information link*, i.e. an indicator that the value of a stock is a factor in the size of a flow

If your model is good, things like feedback loops and bottlenecks can show obvious areas for improvement
