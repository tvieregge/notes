Bloom found that teaching the average student using one-to-one [[tutoring]] and [[mastery learning]] techniques performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods

> Bloom conjectured that a combination of two or three altered variables may result in a similar performance improvement. Bloom thus challenged researchers and teachers to "find methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring

This has big implications in [[education]], a two sigma increase in education performance is huge. If we can get half of this with a reasonable amount of resources that would be huge.
