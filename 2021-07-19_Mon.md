I got almost no "work" done today (although I did do some decent research/note taking). I spend a bunch of the day thinking "I can do it later", so I'm going to experiment with [[hard time boundries on work]] 

I'm going to start recording the rough amount of time I spent working in a day to see if it improves, or at least get a baseline

Work done: ~1h + 2h meetings
