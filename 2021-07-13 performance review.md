Misc thoughts
- I hate [[voltech]] duty

Thoughts for new goals
- If I want to move more into voltlet stuff, think about owning that more and planning what scaling issues come with operation UV etc.
- More communication around stuff I'm working on: PR presentation etc, look to liza/timb for what they do
- How do we measure consolidation? Maybe a goal around contribution to spruce up. Make sure every project is up to a self defined standard. Higher level construct would make this and the vault config annoyance easier to deal with
- Single goal statement: TODO

Clear on how to participate

Many of these seem like they will be longer term. Any way to break them up? Maybe do one at a time? That might help build habits that aren't forgetten when working on other things.

#### Upward review of [[max]]
No worries
Issues are around but improving
org, under your responsibility: gettign thigs from discussions to implementation
personal: getting amped up

#### Self review
Performance: 3/4 depending on the grading scale
Culture: 4. I at least made solid imrovements here

Performance: 4, imporved about communicated skils/delays, good ownership over voltlet space: working with bill, external communications, owned buisines problems. Communication feedback: invest in project planning and docs as way to spread information around the org. Use this to show how to make the things you own success over time.
Culture: 5, always show up, interviewing is good

Interviewing: I don't have much reference over the actual interview process, maybe we should double up for some?

Voltlet: get other people on board
