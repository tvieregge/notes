- [x] figure out deploy process

#### Voltlet deploy
I'm going to keep notes here to keep everything straight. Might help show the pain points as well

**Currently running:**
voltapp: off of master w/o program stacking
collector: off of master w/o program stacking
Voltlet: version 1.1.24:e6d36661b15f8d7039d15bf4c5dfb04d1f8f76b8
aka 1.1.22.rc1

**Original code deployed:**
voltapp: 8055-collector-w-parent commits before the 25th
collector: same
voltlet: version 1.1.23, uses current HEAD of master:f0d42c690c3e985e33a3cd1f5933a37ec6fdc782

**New code:**
voltapp: 8055-collector-w-parent, newest commits
collector: same
voltlet: 1.1.23.2 ?

**Deploy order**
Voltapp before collector
Voltlet <-> collector changes: collector first. Votllet first means we have to worry about forwards and backwards since voltlets take a while to update

Work done: 2.5h+ 2h meeting
