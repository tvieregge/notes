> We have more faith in what we imitate than in what we originate. We cannot derive a sense of absolute certitude from anything that has its roots in us. The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone; we are not alone when we imitate. It is thus with most of us! We are what other people say we are. We know ourselves chiefly by hearsay.

- Bruce Lee

This is very close to the idea of [[looking to other for acceptance]], but focuses on knowing-self rather than accepting-self. I guess the more general trend is [[looking to others for reference]]
