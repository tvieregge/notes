An idea taken from [David Mytton](https://davidmytton.blog/iuse/).

Once a year (or whatever period), record what I'm using for my personal computer setup. It should be interesting to see how things change.

I wonder if this page would be redendant with good/enough notes?

I'll set a reminder for sometime around new year [[2021-12-30_Thu]] to record again.
