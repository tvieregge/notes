Another option: Spotting scope. Much more portabe, with decent magnification

Tripod recommended by [[serg]]: https://www.henrys.com/90191-VANGUARD-VS-82-MACRO-TABLE-TOP-TRIPOD.aspx
This seems like a good one, the [Celestron 52250 80mm Ultima](https://www.amazon.ca/Celestron-52250-Ultima-Spotting-Scope/dp/B0002CTZ70/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Celestron%2BUltima%2B80&qid=1625795442&sr=8-1&th=1)
