A possible improvment for my [[note_taking]]

Recall is often based on temporal clues. I often find myself asking questions like:

*What was that note I wrote the same day as this other note?*
And
*What was the order I updated these notes?*

Of which you can imagine many more...

I can get a lot of the information from sorting by last edited, and could get even more by incluting the date of creation (maybe though [[use front matter in obsidian]]) but using git would give me all the information I need for this. It might be a little heavyweight though.

I'll start tacking things and see if it pays off.

I'll be using the obsidian git plugin
