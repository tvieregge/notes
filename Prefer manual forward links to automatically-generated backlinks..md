While backlinks are useful when automatically generated by the note taking system they provide less utility than forward links.

If you link from note A to note B that creates a _forward_ link. Some tools will automatically create a _backlink_ by simply listing in B that A links to B, but it won't provide any _reason_ for the link.

You should manually add the link when it would be useful to your future self to navigate _forward_ from B to A as well.

Forward links allow you to provide meaningful context. Think of it like writing a transition sentence or citation phrase in an essay or book. With a manually created forward link you can write things like:

-   For further elaboration on this concept see \[\[B\]\]
    
-   See \[\[B\]\] for contradictions of this idea
    
-   Background: \[\[B\]\]
    
-   Compare this idea with \[\[B\]\] which takes a more nuanced view
    
-   As an example of this idea in action, compare \[\[B\]\] to \[\[C\]\]
    
-   ... etc
    

Not every link from A to B warrants a corresponding manual link from B to A. Use them where appropriate based on your understanding and context.

Notice also that this implies writing notes in more narrative form where possible, which is more of what SÃ¶nke Ahrens advocates and how Andy Matuschak writes his notes.
