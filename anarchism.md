### Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century   
### by Andrej Grubacic & David Graeber

Anarchists by other names: direct democracy, autonomism, anti-authoritarianism   
Core principles: decentralization, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means   
Point: anarchism as an ethics of practise, build a new society withing the current   
The efforts in the 20th century to overcome capitalism by taking control of the government failed, mostly very badly   
Instead de-legitimize/dismantle mechanisms of rule and increase autonomy/participatory mgmt   
Revolution won't be a grand moment, but a gradual change   
Maybe should never stop
