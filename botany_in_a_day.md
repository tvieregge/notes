Not very many plant remains in fossil record (all soft tissue)
Evolution occurs gradually and suddenly. Often occurs "on the margin" before becoming common

Evolution of plants, pg. 6 for full table
* 3.8 b.y.a. - prokaryotes
* 2.5 b.y.a. - eukaryotes
* 1.6 b.y.a. - bisexual reproduction
* 0.9 b.y.a. - multicellular life
* 510 m.y.a. - plant fungus symbiosis on land
* 440 m.y.a. - vascular plants

General process of plant evolution:
* spore plants, __no__ vascular system
* spore plants, vascular system
* 360 m.y.a. - naked seed
* 130 m.y.a - flowering
* monocots, dicots, eudicots
* specialized flowers
* composite flowers

Lichen aren't really a plant, doing they're own thing

To transition to land, plants had to go from floating in the nutrient stream to holding it inside (water)

90% of plants associate w/ fungus, 80% require it to live

Evaporation pumps nutrients up the plant

### Spores
spores drop to the ground, then grow into thallus (has both male and female sex organs)
after fertilization, grows into new plant

### Spore Plants, no Vascular System
Mosses, hornworts, liverworts
Can't move nutrients around
    Limits their size

### Spore Plants with a Vascular System
Likely started with gene exchange with fungi

### Naked Seed
fertilization on the mother plant
starts growing into a new plant, stops as a seed
e.x. conifers have modified leaves that form cones, males release pollen that goes into female cones and directly lands on egg cells

## Flowing Plants
Evolution: leaves -> sepals -> petals -> stamen
Seeds enclosed in plant in ovules
Chemicals used by pollen to burrow through pistil
