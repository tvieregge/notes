This is an explanation of my note taking workflow as of roughly [[2021-07-19_Mon]]. It is by no means perfect, and is very much a work in progress

1. A thought appears. There are two sources, something from a permanent source (internet, book) or a passing though
2. The incoming thoughts then go to the [[reading inbox for incoming material]]. This step is a mess, here are the options:
    - A new note with the [[incomplete tag]]: Pretty self explanitory. These are in the defualt folder and can be eaily manually created with a markdown editor on my phone.
    - A browser tab: This is probably the most common. I send all the things I find online to my personal laptop (helps to [[limit distractions]]) with [[firefox]]. These often end up with short notes and an [[incomplete tag]] line like the previous point
    - The `inbox` folder in this vault. This doesn't really get used except to hold some old notes
    - New blank note: I often forward link to new notes while writing, this leads to a bunch of empty notes
    - The current [[daily notes]] file. This may get pulled out into it's own note, or not (which is fine)
3. They become [[permanent notes]] 


The above is for my main day-to-day [[note_taking]]. When I'm reading a source that I specifically ready to take notes from like a particular book, I'll make a note for that source with the `#reference` tag.

Remeber not to over formalize, [[better note taking isn't the goal, it's better thinking]]
