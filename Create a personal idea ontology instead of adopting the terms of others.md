Sönke Ahrens makes the following point regarding tags in _How to Take Smart Notes_:

> The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer [[note taking like a archivist vs an author]]. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.

David Kadavy expands on this:

> I avoid generic keywords such as “Psychology.” Instead I create keywords based upon patterns I see, which inform theories I’m working on.

He uses an example tag `#IcebergPrinciple` to denote permanent/evergreen notes that reflect a particular theme or idea.

> This Hemingway advice is so beautiful, I’ve made it the basis of one of my keywords. I call it the `#IcebergPrinciple`. Basically, any creative work you see is the tip of the iceberg. There’s much more work and knowledge going on behind the scenes.

> McKee’s advice is about how 75 percent of the work on a screenplay goes into the climax. This advice is connected to Hemingway’s advice about most of an iceberg being underwater. So, my Permanent Note for the McKee quote is not tagged `#writing`, nor `#screenwriting`, but `#IcebergPrinciple`.
