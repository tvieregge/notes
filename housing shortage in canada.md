### What's going on
Increasing immigration and low building rates have lead to a shortage of housing units. Factors like low interest rates are secondary (maybe they are allowing prices to rise to equilibrium faster?).

There is a small blip in house prices because of shifting preferences during [[covid-19]], but the main cause is a supply-demand mismatch which has been around for years, so that's what we should target.

Canada now sits at the lowest number of dwellings per capita of all G7 nations

To keep out levels the same as 2016 we would need another 100 thousand dwellings, to get to the G7 average would require another 1.8 million homes. Canada has built an average of 188 thousand homes per year, so to get to the average would require **9 years of building at once**. This is a *very* rough guide though, we shouldn't go that crazy.

The population of canada is likely to continue to grow, so we are going to need to build even more that this annalysis would suggest. Prior to covid-19 the ratio of completed housing to population rise was the lowest level ever seen.

This would make [[ottawa]]'s (plus [[gatineau]]'s) share:
$$1.8M(1.48M/38M)=71K$$
But the housing shortage isn't evenly disributed between cities, so this number has an extra level of unknowns too it. (See list below)

It's worth noting that [[Montreal]] has the most housing units per capita of the large canadian cities, and has fairly affordable housing.

### What should we do about it
In the medium to long term, building more is the obvious answer. We need to make our housing market more responsive to demand.

##### So why aren't we building more?
The main complaints from the building industy are:
- The entitlement process is very lengthy and unduly political. Many processes can delay or derail development applications and this can be exacerbated by under-resourced planning departments within cities
- The structure of requirements to build inclusive housing can put a cap on returns, limiting investor interest
- Rent control
- Rising development charges applied to new developments; specifically requirements to find accommodations for existing tenants in proximity to their current residence

These are mostly in the planning and approval process. This is something the government has direct control over, but needs to be solved for each minicipality/province

##### What we can do about that
We don't want anything that disensentivises development, but we still want affordable housing. To make this happen we should implement property tax abatements for rental units with affordable components like the [[Affordable New York program]]

Take a look at the obstacles listed in the [[#So why aren't we building more]] and start reworking them, like in the prev paragraph

Would changes in [[urban planning]] policy to increased [[housing density]] make a noticeable difference? Some back-of-the-napkin math would probably give a decent idea, but I'm sure someone has done some thorough reaserch. Maybe the [[ottawa official plan]] can give a benchmark based on their plans.

##### What about the short term?
