We use  a take home question for the last part of the [[interviewing]] at [[voltus]]

#### Does this harm diversity?
Not everyone has the 4 (realisticly more like 8) hours needed to do a good job at it.


#### Does it help?
It gives a pretty strong technical signal. It has changed our decision on hiring multiple times in the past (from [[neil]])

Ex. Getting a solution that is so unreadable there must be a philisophical difference in how they approach writing code
   
#### Alternatives
- [[pair programming]]
- do a fizzbang type thing, get 30% of the signal from 5% of the work?
