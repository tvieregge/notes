The experimentation and reversibility afforded by temporary use practices can encourage a multilayered approach to land use and increase the likelihood that a vacant space will eventually find permanent use.

Things that are needed:
1. A suitable site: One that doesn't require too much investment to make suitable for use, and isn't too far off the beaten track
2. People to initiate the project: Usually there isn't much financial backing, need people with energy and commitment
3. The other supporters: Officials that set up the framework (permits, lease contracts ect.), both policy makers and administrators. E.g. more open food vending regualtions allowed Southworth cities Portland to use vacant land for well received food vending
4. The public: People need to show up

Common strategies
- community green spaces, see [[Green Guerrillas]] in 1970s NYC, [[Rewilding]]
- special event spaces
- pop-up shops. Commercial, but low barrier to entry can help revitalize an are. See [[Eco-interstice]], a community garden/classroom/park in paris

Low start up costs can bootstrap underutilized land. Like [[make small bets]] concept from [[strong_towns]]

Flexibility allows them to follow [[iterate and improve]] and to react to changes

Temporary use tends to lead to permanent use: [Public Life, Public Space, and the Changing Art of City Design](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13574809.2014.854684#.UvJU3_ldV1Y)

Benefits for land owner: Revenue will likely be small, but the maintenance done can be highly beneficial

Potential drawbacks
- resistance to use by original authority after improvements
- political/legan tension from ^
