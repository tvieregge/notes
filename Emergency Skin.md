Focused on the social issues caused by modern [[Big-L libertarians]]/white suprememsists/super rich
Kinda over the top and sipmlified, not a huge fan of the story/concept
Writing was well done, and interesting. The story was written from the perspective of an AI implanted in the protagonists brain.
From [[Best Science Fiction of the Year Vol. 5]]
