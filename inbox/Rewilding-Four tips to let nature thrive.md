### Rewilding
objective: increasing the health of an ecosystem by increasing the number of species and much they can interact

principle: give more space and time to nature, allow nature to become self willed

Don't need to exclude people from the nature. Can help them develop a stronger relationship through engagment (wildlife surveys, wetland restoration etc.)

Need to include people who will be affected in the discussion. To ensure this, have the staff based locally.
