### Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century   
### by Andrej Grubacic & David Graeber

An essay on [[anarchism]]

Anarchists by other names: direct democracy, autonomism, anti-authoritarianism   
Core principles: decentralization, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means   
Point: anarchism as an ethics of practise, build a new society withing the current   
The efforts in the 20th century to overcome capitalism by taking control of the government failed, mostly very badly   
Instead de-legitimize/dismantle mechanisms of rule and increase autonomy/participatory mgmt   
Revolution won't be a grand moment, but a gradual change   
Maybe should never stop
This allows us to see what the results are as we are changing things. Crimethinc Collective:
“Freedom only exists in the moment of revolution. And those moments are not as rare as you
think.”
Practicing approximately what you think society should look like is ethically imperative and is required to stop the backs slide of any progress made
Not much academic work on anarchism
Anarchism isn't a new thing, just basic principles of humanity
Requires some faith: "a belief that most forms of irresponsibility that seem to
make power necessary are in fact the effects of power itself"
In practice, a constant questioning to identify hierarchy and see if it is justified
Anarchist groups generally emerge from a principle, not a person
Anarchism is practical rather than theoretical
A divide between older forms of anarchism that organizes through named Anarchist federations (IWA) and the newer more socially oriented groups (people's global action)
