This tag hasn't been useful for searching, and seems to do the opposite of [[close open loops]]. I'll keep using it for now, but I'm leaning towards depreciating it.

a complement to the [[reference tag]]?
Looking for sources that have been only shallowly looked into would be `#reference && #incomplete`

Questions:
- can non references be incomlete?
    - is this an example of that?
- do we just want an `#incoming` tag instread of doing the `search`
