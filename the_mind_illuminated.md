## Overview of the Ten Stages
* Stages represent building levels of skill
* You may be in multipe stages at once
* You may move through different stages over different day or throught a single sit
* Using skills you learn from meditation in your daily life will greatl speed progress

The rest of this chapter has an outline of each stage that is ver useful to look back on,
 but I wont include here.

## First Interlude

__Consciousness__: The sum of what we are experiencing. It consists of __attention__ and
__peripheral awareness__ which work together like visual focus and peripheral vision.

__Attention__: Picks an object from the field of consciousness and analyzes it. An example
is deciding whether the object lying on the road is a snake or rope.

__Stable Attention__ is reached when the attention is directed and focused, as opposed to:

* Scanning: focus moving around looking for something more interesting
* Getting captured: attention being captured by another stumulus
* Alternating: focus of attention quickly alternates between objects. Appears like multitasking
Can also be happening if something stands out from PA (you're writing an email and noticing
the cat meowing)

__Peripheral Awareness__: The general awareness of everything. It filters out information
it thinks in unimportant. It also profides quick reations that don't have time for analysis.

__Extrospective__ vs. __Introspective__: Extrospective means it is directed outside the the mind,
introspective means internal to the mind (thoughts, feeling etc.).

Attention and PA can be either of these, but only PA can observe the state of the mind as a whole (can't pay attention to
attention).

Attention and PA draw from the same source (consciousness), there must be a trade off.
Training attention and PA at the same time is what increases power of consciousness,

__Sustained Attention__: When stable attention is sustained.

Directing attention is not a conscious process. Need to train the unconscious to maintain sustained
attention.

__Example__  
Your partner has a bad day at work and complains about the food you made. It takes *mindfulness*
to to maintain an objective awareness and realize what the complainet is really about. It take
a more powerful consciousness to have the energy to deal with the strong emotions while
maintaining mindfulness.
