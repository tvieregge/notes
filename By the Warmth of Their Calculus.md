This story covered a biological ship from a matriarchal post-apocalypse spacefaring scociety running away from technology seeking killer robots while trying not to overheat

Kinda a lot for a short story, but pretty well done

The matriachal society was the most explored aspect. It wasn't neccessarily the most interesting, but the gender reversal in the sexism and patronizing writing was jarring and well done
