A large [[nation backed science project]] that could happen. Is being investigated by [[NASA]]

Involves using the gravitational lensing of the sun to act as a telescope. Could get ~25km resolution at 100 light years! This would allow us to see surface features of [[exoplanets]].

Requires getting a small telescope out the the focal length, ~500AU away. Medium sized [[solar sails]] are suggested (16 sections of 1000$m^2$) which could get there in 17 years.
