Advice about using [[obsidian]] for [[note_taking]].

Tags are meta-information, pages are for entities or subjects

If you are doing something like project management then I use tags heavily in that scenario. If you are doing something like a zettelkasten then I don't use tags in that scenario

Forward links are intentional. Relying solely on backlinks can become lazy and lead you into the Collector's Fallacy: [https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/)

Below are the contents of some of my notes on this topic.

> Extensive content-based tagging is a known anti-pattern because tags create a weak association _at best_ between notes.
> 
> By using content-based tags you are making yourself feel that you are creating associations but you are still really shifting the burden to your future self to figure out _why_ the notes are associated.
> 
> This becomes a significant problem when you have a larger corpus and your tag ontology begins growing beyond control.
> 
> Once you decide to tag based on subject you have to keep expanding the subjects you tag.
> 
> Then every time you add a tag later you have to decide if you will go back and re-tag all applicable prior notes, which quickly becomes untenable.
> 
> But if you don't do that then your tagging system becomes untrustworthy, because it is not returning all notes that it should, so you start developing workarounds to compensate for the faulty tagging system, which increases the friction of using the system.
