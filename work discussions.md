Stuff that I think should be talked about at [[voltus]]

#### Slack
- mention stack overflow for work
    
#### Team meetings
- teams getting splintered https://github.com/voltusdev/voltus/discussions/8543
- How do we follow up on discussion? We have some good ones that fizzle out
- formalize 1 on 1 meeting with team for new hires?
