### Preface(s)
__Criticisms__:
 * oversimplification of German history
 * Lots of problems pointed out, but not many solutions/alternatives. Some given in The Constitution of Liberty
 * Not enough done to address market socialism. He did some previous writing on it
 * Slippery slope argument that any planning leads to totalitarianism. Hayek denies it's implied by the book
Revisit after reading

Socialism in this book refers to the nationalization of the means of production, not the modern welfare state. This leads to the same outcomes, but more slowly and by slightly different means

This book goes too easy on Russia/Soviet Union. There wasn't much awareness of what was going on when this book was written, and they were a wartime ally

### Introduction

contempt of liberalism, cynicism, wartime powers carrying over

### One
The Abandoned Road

people don't want to admit their ideas are wrong, blame any failures on the people implementing them. Ex. "The Germans became fascist because they're a vicious peoples"

The world is becoming less liberal, moving away from the basic ideals that build western civilization. These ideals let to so much progress that it's hard to see how well they're working, we live in the progress.

Liberalism doesn't have fixed rules, we should be working to improve the (liberal) system we've got.
"Probably nothing more has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez fail". _Spicy!_

### Two
The Great Utopia

Socialism started in the french revolution as 100% authoritarian, promised _economic freedom_ aka wealth.

Socialism and fascism clash not because they are different, but because they compete for the same type of people.

### Three
Individualism and Collectivism

The methods of planning that would lead to an equal/just society are the same that would be used to funnel all resources to a specific group

Liberalism should still involve making political decisions with foresight, i.e. planning

We should regulate things where price doesn't work, e.g. externalities, this doesn't mean all competition should go away

A good legal framework is required.

We haven't tried that hard to create a good framework for competition, lots of room for improvement.
How much work have we put in since this was written?

Central planning and competition together work worse than either by itself. Planning for competition is good, planning against (or to replace) competition is what messes it up.

### Four
The "Inevitability" of Planning

Centralized planning, and the monopolies that help push us toward them, are not inevitable or caused by technological progress. They are the result of deliberate government policies.

There are some situations in which planning beats competition, namely where standardization leads to increase in efficiency, e.g. everyone uses the same car. But the benefit of using planning is outweighed by the cost of the restrictions. It narrows your future choices.
Not sure this holds up everywhere - vaccines

### Five
Planning and Democracy

Planning an economy requires a goal to aim for, which necessitates the ordering of preferences and ethics for everyone involved. Just because you want an outcome doesn't mean others do.

Common action is limited to actions where the people want common ends. These need concrete, actionable definitions, "common welfare" isn't enough.

Be careful delegating powers to people outside the democratic process, especially when they will have to choose between ends (goals as above).

Democracy doesn't stop decisions being made arbitrarily, or mean all it's decisions are good, e.g. applying the will of the majority (or vocal minority) on everyone.

Democracy is a means to an end.

### Six
Planning and the Rule of Law

The important thing with laws is that they are applied consistently and predictably, so that the individual can know how any coercive powers will be used. Central planning invalidates this, since the planner must make changes as conditions arise, e.g. grow more pigs instead of cows.
Fairness isn't mentioned here... Also, is this so different than introducing a law that incentivises the production of pigs over cows? Maybe the speed of laws passing is the difference, maybe the author would be against that for reasons mentioned earlier.

Retroactive judging of actions is a difference for ^

Author mentions this is hard, example given to illustrate difference: The difference between providing signposts and telling people which road to take.

Formal laws that are useful to unknown people for unknown aims are the best. This makes sense to stop invested parties passing laws (lobbyists come to mind) but seems hard in practice.

Applying the same laws to everyone means that people are treated the same -> different groups of people won't be specifically disadvantaged.
This goes hard against the current zeitgeist, doesn't seem to deal with concentration of wealth either.

### Seven
Economic Control and Totalitarianism

Economic control grants planners control over almost all aspects of life, even if used indirectly. There is no "only give them power over economic matters" option.
This is true both for the consumption and production (job) perspectives of individuals.

The state can still do things to help, e.g. access to information.

Doesn't seem to address taxes here.

### Eight
Who, Whom?

Private property keeps power distributed between many people, avoiding concentration of power.

It's better to have a world where the wealthy are powerful than where only the already powerful can gain wealth.
Is this actually meaningful?

People prefer inequality to come from something impersonal. Suffering as the result of the decisions of authority are much less tolerated.

There is no general moral code in society -> we can't provide a just price/wage the will be agreed upon.

Political parties that seek power have in mind the advancement of a particular group. With that power eventually the only way to for people to advance is by using the coercive power of the state, and the only way to gain that is through that political party

### Nine
Security and Freedom

Basic economic security of the necessities is compatible with liberalism, it is the economic security that involves setting status relative to others that doesn't work.
Hayek seemed to be in support of UBI later on

Social welfare for unpredictable disasters (insurance) is also a net benefit. There's no way for the individual to plan against it.

If the basic security given to citizens is higher than the normal security in other countries it could cause practical political issues.
