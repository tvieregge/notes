### Preface(s)
__Criticisms__:
 * oversimplification of German history
 * Lots of problems pointed out, but not many solutions/alternatives. Some given in The Constitution of Liberty
 * Not enough done to address market socialism. He did some previous writing on it
 * Slippery slope argument that any planning leads to totalitarianism. Hayek denies it's implied by the book
Revisit after reading

Socialism in this book refers to the nationalization of the means of production, not the modern welfare state. This leads to the same outcomes, but more slowly and by slightly different means

This book goes too easy on Russia/Soviet Union. There wasn't much awareness of what was going on when this book was written, and they were a wartime ally

### Introduction

contempt of liberalism, cynicism, wartime powers carrying over

### One
The Abandoned Road

people don't want to admit their ideas are wrong, blame any failures on the people implementing them. Ex. "The Germans became fascist because they're a vicious peoples"

The world is becoming less liberal, moving away from the basic ideals that build western civilization. These ideals let to so much progress that it's hard to see how well they're working, we live in the progress.

Liberalism doesn't have fixed rules, we should be working to improve the (liberal) system we've got.
"Probably nothing more has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez fail". _Spicy!_

### Two
The Great Utopia

Socialism started in the french revolution as 100% authoritarian, promised _economic freedom_ aka wealth.

Socialism and fascism clash not because they are different, but because they compete for the same type of people.

### Three
Individualism and Collectivism

The methods of planning that would lead to an equal/just society are the same that would be used to funnel all resources to a specific group

Liberalism should still involve making political decisions with foresight, i.e. planning

We should regulate things where price doesn't work, e.g. externalities, this doesn't mean all competition should go away

A good legal framework is required.

We haven't tried that hard to create a good framework for competition, lots of room for improvement.
How much work have we put in since this was written?

Central planning and competition together work worse than either by itself. Planning for competition is good, planning against (or to replace) competition is what messes it up.

### Four
The "Inevitability" of Planning

Centralized planning, and the monopolies that help push us toward them, are not inevitable or caused by technological progress. They are the result of deliberate government policies.
