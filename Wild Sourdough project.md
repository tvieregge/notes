a [[citizen science]] project looking into the [[microbiology]] of [[bread]] 

> We will guide you through creating a “wild” sourdough starter using only water and flour following a ten-day protocol. If you are curious (and a little ambitious), we are hoping to recruit some folks who want to make more than one starter using different flour types or using the same flour type but setting one outside and one inside your home.
>
> Once you have made your starter we will ask you to observe it and record some observations about its aroma and how fast it rises. You will submit these data through a short online questionnaire.
