#incomplete 

When writing [[haskell]], [[tactics]] are used to fill in function definitions once the types are definied. Becaue of haskell's type system this often gives you near-complete functions

>Isn’t it weird that we treat source code as text? That is, we have this extremely well-structured and strongly-typed object — the abstract syntax tree — that exists conceptually in our minds, and in actuality inside of our compiler, but for some reason we pretend it’s just a pile of bytes and edit it byte-by-byte rather than semantically?
