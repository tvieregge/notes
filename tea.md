Tea is good
Here are some I've been drinking
- [jade cloud](https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/jade-cloud): I like it, caffeine doesn't hit too hard
- White Tea Rose Melange: Hate it. I really don't like the rose flavor
- [Bancha](https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/bancha): A little bitter, but overall nice. The caffeine can be a little intence
- [Nishi First Flush Sencha](https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/nishi-first-flush-sencha): So much umami. Too much for me, but I can see it's appeal
- [Jasmine Green Tea](https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/jasmine-green-tea): Eh. Nice to have sometimes but I don't live it. Makes pretty good iced tea
- [Sencha Superior](https://rishi-tea.com/green-tea-organic-loose-leaf/sencha-superior): Only tired once, but I think I like it. Cheaper than the normal sencha?
- [Earl Grey](https://rishi-tea.com/black-tea-organic-loose-leaf/earl-grey): Good! Lots of flavor
- [Masala Chai](https://rishi-tea.com/black-tea-organic-loose-leaf/masala-chai-loose-leaf): Yum! This one is good. Maybe it's just all the milk though... 
- [Silver Needles](https://rishi-tea.com/white-tea-organic-loose-leaf/silver-needles): Savory, but not overly so. Pretty nice, but too much caffiene

Some that I'd like to try
- [Sencha Nagashima](https://camellia-sinensis.com/en/sencha-nagashima-organic/2318): Sencha with a nutty finish. Popular
- [Sencha Yame Harukaze](https://camellia-sinensis.com/en/sencha-yame-harukaze/7866): Less vegetal sencha
