### Part one, prospection
Humans plan for the future, a lot, and it is an important part of life   
When we plan, we are usually optimistic (unless you're depressed)   
Anticipating bad outcomes make them less painful   
Humans like to control things. Going as far as to act as though we can control things we can't   
The concept of *later* is important, but you can mostly function without it (frontal lobe damage)

### Part 2, subjectivity
There are different types of happiness (the word is used in different ways), we'll be talking about emotional happiness (feeling happy)   
When someone make a claim of happiness it's from someone's point of view, a single person with a context of past experiences   
Since people are changed by experiences, it permanently changes their view of previous events. Ex: Once you learn to read you can't see letters as just squiggles   
A bunch of stuff comes out of this

* Remembering happiness is inaccurate, since your point of view has changed (possibly of other reasons as well)
* So, __comparing new happiness with remembered is risky__. Also hard to compare different past happinesses to each other   
* People in situations that *you* think are bad can still be happy (their point of view is different)   

__Experience stretching hypothesis__: the amount of happiness experienced is different for a single event if people/previous experiences are different (drinking water when thirsty vs not)   
Humans only notice change if they are focused on an aspect of something as it changes   


The response to a stimuli is happening as we are deciding exactly what it is (wolverine is scary, which makes flight or fight response happen, before we know it is a wolverine)
Signals can get mixed (ex pg 63-64)
Feeling something and believing you are feeling it are different.
You can experience something workout being aware you did ( ex pg 65)
This is looking like meditation ideas
You are still retaining information when this happens (see blind sight)
Can also have feeling without being aware of them (numbfeel) a lack of introspection
Can't measure happiness perfect, but can't measure anything perfectly
Reported Measure  of happiness in the moment is most accurate

### Part 3, realism
Imagining what we would feel like in situations is important, and we are bad at it
