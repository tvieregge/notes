## Part One
### Prospection
Humans think about the future, a lot, and it is an important part of life.

When we think about the future we usually imagine good outcomes, which biases us toward being optimistic (unless you're depressed). When we do imagine bad outcomes it makes them less painful if they do occur (pain we can't anticipate is more severe).

Thinking about the future is also common to anxiety, and not thinking about the future is difficult. Meditation is a practise which can be used to stop it.

Humans like to control things. Going as far as to act as though we can control things we can't. The idea that you are in control is important for happiness.

The concept of *later* is important, but you can mostly function without it (frontal lobe damage).

## Part Two
### Subjectivity
There are different types of happiness (the word is used in different ways), we'll be talking about emotional happiness (feeling happy).

When someone make a claim of happiness it's from someone's point of view, a single person with a context of past experiences. Since people are changed by experiences, it permanently changes their view of previous events. Ex: Once you learn to read you can't see letters as just squiggles.

A bunch of stuff comes out of this

* Remembering happiness is inaccurate, since your point of view has changed (possibly of other reasons as well)
* So, __comparing new happiness with remembered is risky__. Also hard to compare different past happinesses to each other
* People in situations that *you* think are bad can still be happy (their point of view is different)

__Experience stretching hypothesis__: the amount of happiness experienced is different for a single event if people/previous experiences are different (drinking water when thirsty vs not).

Humans only notice change if they are focused on an aspect of something as it changes. Example of changing (tHiS -> ThIs) that will not be noticed if they eye is focused elsewhere during the switch.

The response to a stimuli is happening *as* we are deciding exactly what it is (wolverine is scary, which makes flight or fight response happen, before we know it is a wolverine).

Emotional signals can get mixed. Example given is if men met a woman on a high swaying bridge they were more likely to call her back than if they met her in a safer scenario, indicating emotions are getting confused (arousal from fear with sexual arousal). This implies __you can be wrong about what you are feeling and why__.

Feeling something and believing you are feeling it are different.

You can experience something without being aware you did. Example of realizing you weren't paying attention to what you were reading, buy you still have information from the text. The visual processes must have happened to get the information, but you have no memory of the experience. __This is looking like meditation ideas, awareness vs attention__. Blindsight is another example of this. Being able to navigate a room without the experience of being able to see.

Numbfeel: The inability to describe emotional state. You would have normal physiological reactions to a strong stimulus (a picture of a car wreck etc.) but couldn't distinguish it from a normal ones. You have to emotional response, but aren't aware of it.

Can't measure happiness perfect, but can't measure anything perfectly. Have to accept the inaccuracy and use the law of large numbers to help.

Self reported, real-time, attentive (see prev point on "Humans only notice change") measure of happiness is most accurate method we have.

Any work on quantifying the inaccuracy?

## Part Three
### Realism
Imagination is the tool we use to determine how we would feel in different situations in the future (what would it feel like if..., would I be happier as a painter or potter?). __We make mistakes when doing this__, example of happy martyr vs suicidal rich philanthropist.

The problems with perception (seeing the present) and memory (seeing the past) are one of the ways we make mistakes with imagination (seeing the future).

Memories are done with very lossy compression, only keeping the overall *gist* of what was going on. When we recall a memory we are synthesizing an experience from the remembered gist, then re-compressing the memory (recollection changes memory). This abstraction is opaque, you can't tell what was filled in vs not after the fact.

A similar effect of filling in happens with perception. This happens seamlessly, even when a delay is present. A missing sound (e.g. from a cough) at the beginning of a sentence will be filled in differently based on the sentence's ending Ex: in "[cough]eel was on the shoe" the first word will be heard as heel vs "[cough]eel was on the orange" will be heard as peel.

__Realism__: things are unchanged by our perception. In this case of cognition, things are as we see them (the same for all observers)

Children start as *realists*, not distinguishing between things in the world and things in their mind, this leads to problems such as confusing personal vs global knowledge. As we age we learn to act as *idealists*, but this is an override we learn to apply when it is worth the energy/time. We still behave as realists initially (see P.O.V. experiment pg 96).

Idealism, the idea that our perception of the world is mentally constructed from a combination of how the world is and our own mental state (thoughts, wants, feelings etc.).

Seems like [Attribution Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution).

Imagination fills in details (imagine "pasta dinner" and you will imagine sauce, setting etc.), which is necessary, but then __we treat these details as the truth__ which is problematic. People asked how much they would spend at a celebration dinner were equally sure of their guess regardless of the level of detail they confirmed with the experimenter i.e. whether the details were real or imagined. 

How to get around this? *Superforecasting* is an idea to look into (from Jamie Brandon).

People take into account things they notice more than things they don't notice. That is, if they try to figure out if P -> Q they don't look at if !P -> !Q, or they don't look at P(Evidence|Scenario) in Bayes Theorem. This leads to problems like selection bias and the base rate fallacy.

Bayesian inference: P(A|E) = (P(E|A)P(A))/P(E)

This also leads to paradoxes like something being the best and worst at the same time. An example is groups of subjects picking which countries were the most similar or different. They answered the same for both because when asked for similarities they ignored the dissimilarities and vice-versa.

Corollary: People tend to only look at positive aspect when asked what to keep, and negative when looked at what to get rid of.

When we use our imagination to predict our future happiness we similarly only look at the details we *do* imagine and forget to take into account everything the imagination left out.

Example: Most Americans think they would be happier living in California than somewhere else, but people in California aren't any more happy. This is people overestimating how much the weather/scenery will make them happy and forgetting about everything else (housing cost, traffic). __This seems like Attribution Substitution again, you can't take into account *everything*, so you substitute it with "the thing that is different"__.

The author suggests an idea: When students were asked to describe the events of a typical day they were more accurate at prediction the impact of an event (the outcome of a football game) on their happiness.

Events in the near future are imagined in more detail than events farther out.

We don't take this into account. When asked to describe a good day subjects would use a larger variety of events than if it was a year away. The next-day group described a more realistic mix of positive and negative events, but __both groups rated how realistic their descriptions were the same__.

This leads us to make decisions about the future based on the fuzzy description (agreeing to do a favour that sounds good in theory, but sucks mush worse than imagined in practise).

When the brain does filling with memory it used today as the model. Eg when middle aged people were asked about their past (e.g. how much they drank in college) their opinion is influenced by their present (e.g. how much they drink now).

Similarly this happens with imagination, since the whole thing is being filled in. We consistently fail to imagine how different the future will be, especially our future emotions (Not buying enough food at the grocery store if you are full).

## Part Four
### Presentism
When the brain wants to imagine a sensation (like the high note in Happy Birthday) it uses the part of the brain that produces that sense (hearing) and you actually have the sensation (hear the note).

A similar thing happens with emotions. If you try to imagine what you will feel like in a scenario (like infidelity) you actually feel the emotions as if it were currently happening. Your brain is using how you would feel *now* as a proxy for how you might feel in the future.

Current events get priority over previewing events/prefeeling. We can tell this is happening with previewing, but not prefeeling.

Prefeeling often works better than logical thinking. Eg people picking out art were more satisfied with if they went with their "gut" than if they thought logically.

However it is limited. We cannot distinguish properly distinguish between what we are prefeeling and what we are currently feeling, so we imagine we'll feel in the future the same way we do today.

Example: when calling subjects in different cities, the ones having good weather that day (feeling happy *now*) rated their lives as happier than those with bad weather (feeling sad *now*).

Habituation: decreasing marginal utility.

Variety and time are two factors that can be used to overcome habituation. If the rate is high habituation occurs and variety is needed, if the rate is slow then variety is not needed (marginal utility never decreases).

Imagining time uses space as a metaphor. This leads us to imagine events far away in time in the same space, which leads us to __pick variety even if the rate is low, which decreases our total enjoyment__.

When imagining events in the future we *first* imagine the event *now*, then make adjustments for the time if required. This leads us to stay very close to our starting point if we don't have the cognitive time/energy to do much correction. Eg subjects that were distracted when answering questions about future meal of enjoyment basically answered with current enjoyment.

Regardless of energy, first reaction *anchors* final prediction.

We compare situation relative to each other, not in absolute terms. Ex: An increasing salary over some period of time is valued higher than a decreasing salary with higher total value over that time. Ex2: Coffee went up in price, should I buy it? __The only thing that matters is if the current price is worth it, not that it went up/down.__

When comparing different options we mistake all *possible* options for all *present* options. Ex: All the options at the department store make you forget about the option of *not buying anything*. __This suggests that you should consciously think of the options not presented when making decisions.__

This leads to your decisions being changed by options that don't matter. Ex: subjects where asked to rate how much they would enjoy eating chips. If they were placed beside something unappealing  (sardines) they rated them higher than if beside something appealing (chocolate), but it *did not* change how they rated eating them. __Is this related to anchoring?__

Similarly, this happens over time. Eg buying some excellent sounding but ugly speakers (because they sound better than the other ones at the store) which you regret after taking them home and not having other speakers to compare the audio quality to.

Summary: We determine value by comparison, we can make different comparisons, and our values change based on different comparisons. This implies that to predict how we will feel in the future we need to think of the comparisons we will be making then, and not now.

## Part Five
### Rationalization 

People overestimate the negative impact of negative events (illness, death, heartbreak etc.)

To disambiguate stimuli a few things are particularly important. Take *bank* (the side of a river) vs *bank* (when money is kept).   
__Context__: "The boat ran into the bank". The context of boat -> bank refers to river.   
__Frequency__: "Don't run into the bank". A loan officer usually interacts with (money) banks -> bank refers to building.   
__Recency__: "Put a check in the box". Because we just talked about banking, *check* refers to money transfer, not check-mark.

More importantly, we also disambiguate based on what we *want* to be true. Ex: If you ask people to define the word "talented" they will define it in a way that makes them talented.

Experiences are *very* ambiguous, and when a potential experience becomes an actual experience we tend to disambiguate in favour of it. Eg people rate a job more favourably once they have it. __Is this the same as the previous point?__

We preferentially seek out information that is positive toward us (e.g. reading articles that show why the test we did poorly on isn't useful, seeking out people that did worse on the test than ourselves) or confirms our current bias.

This also applies to people around us. Our friends tend to be people that see us positively, and we tend to put them in situations that lead them to say positive things (What did you like *best* about my cooking?).

Similarly, we hold information that is positive toward us/confirm our biases to lower standard of evidence than the alternative. The difference between facts that *allow* us to continue believing or *compel* us to change.

We generally aren't aware we are doing this, and if we try doing consciously we feel even worse.

The *psychological immune system* is used to rationalize the past, and how easily it can do this affects how we feel.

Ex. Being rejected by a group is worse than a single person.   
Ex. We regret bad inaction more than bad actions. There's less material to work with if you don't take an action (This bad thing happened, but at least I learnt XYZ from it).

This system only kicks in when the experience is bad enough, which leads to *slightly* bad experiences sometimes feeling worse than *very* bad experiences. Ex: subjects felt worse as a bystander to  someone being insulted than as the one being insulted.

I also starts to work when we're stuck with the outcome. We are more critical of things we can change than things we are stuck with (friends vs family, a painting we can return vs not). Because we also value the freedom to change our mind. This can lead us to make decisions that undermine our happiness (e.g. paying extra for the ability to return a painting).

Unexplained events have greater emotional impact, both positive and negative. Subjects that wrote an explanation about a traumatic they were involved with were healthier both physically and mentally; subjects given money by a stranger with no explanation stayed happy longer than ones given money with an explanation.

## Part Six
### Corrigibility

When using past events to predict the future we use how easily we can remember something as a proxy for how likely it is. This fails us in two ways. Some things are easier to recall than others because of the structure of our memory (how many 4 letter words start with k vs end with k) and uncommon things are more memorable (being in the slow line at the grocery store vs a normal speed line).

We have a strong bias toward the end of memories. Participants were put in pain for 60 seconds, then at a different date put in the same pain for 60 seconds with an additional 30 seconds of lesser pain. The session with the additional pain was reported as less painful overall even though it had a strictly greater amount of pain.

This effect goes away when can compare the options in an obvious way.

Not only to do we overestimate how our emotional response to events in the future, but these overestimations affect our *memories* of the events. Participants were asked to guess their emotions given the outcome of an election, then asked when it happened, and finally asked to remember how they felt some time later. The participants remembered an outcome closer to the original prediction than to what they reported.
