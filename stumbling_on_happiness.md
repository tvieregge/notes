### Part one, prospection
Humans think about the future, a lot, and it is an important part of life.

When we think about the future we usually imagine good outcomes, which biases us toward being optimistic (unless you're depressed). When we do imagine bad outcomes it makes them less painful if they do occur (pain we can't anticipate is more severe).

Thinking about the future is also common to anxiety, and not thinking about the future is difficult. Meditation is a practise which can be used to stop it.

Humans like to control things. Going as far as to act as though we can control things we can't. The idea that you are in control is important for happiness.

The concept of *later* is important, but you can mostly function without it (frontal lobe damage).

### Part 2, subjectivity
There are different types of happiness (the word is used in different ways), we'll be talking about emotional happiness (feeling happy).

When someone make a claim of happiness it's from someone's point of view, a single person with a context of past experiences. Since people are changed by experiences, it permanently changes their view of previous events. Ex: Once you learn to read you can't see letters as just squiggles.

A bunch of stuff comes out of this

* Remembering happiness is inaccurate, since your point of view has changed (possibly of other reasons as well)
* So, __comparing new happiness with remembered is risky__. Also hard to compare different past happinesses to each other
* People in situations that *you* think are bad can still be happy (their point of view is different)

__Experience stretching hypothesis__: the amount of happiness experienced is different for a single event if people/previous experiences are different (drinking water when thirsty vs not).

Humans only notice change if they are focused on an aspect of something as it changes. Example of changing (tHiS -> ThIs) that will not be noticed if they eye is focused elsewhere during the switch.

The response to a stimuli is happening *as* we are deciding exactly what it is (wolverine is scary, which makes flight or fight response happen, before we know it is a wolverine).

Emotional signals can get mixed. Example given is if men met a woman on a high swaying bridge they were more likely to call her back than if they met her in a safer scenario, indicating emotions are getting confused (arousal from fear with sexual arousal). This implies __you can be wrong about what you are feeling and why__.

Feeling something and believing you are feeling it are different.

You can experience something without being aware you did. Example of realizing you weren't paying attention to what you were reading, buy you still have information from the text. The visual processes must have happened to get the information, but you have no memory of the experience. __This is looking like meditation ideas, awareness vs attention__. Blindsight is another example of this. Being able to navigate a room without the experience of being able to see.

Numbfeel: The inability to describe emotional state. You would have normal physiological reactions to a strong stimulus (a picture of a car wreck etc.) but couldn't distinguish it from a normal ones. You have to emotional response, but aren't aware of it.

Can't measure happiness perfect, but can't measure anything perfectly. Have to accept the inaccuracy and use the law of large numbers to help.

Self reported, real-time, attentive (see prev point on "Humans only notice change") measure of happiness is most accurate method we have.

Any work on quantifying the inaccuracy?

### Part 3, realism
Imagining what we would feel like in situations is important, and we are bad at it
