We need a system of getting through all material that piles up as we have thoughs and find interesting things to read etc. when doing [[note_taking]]

It needs to:
- be low friction, so we actually use it
- get through sources fater than we produce them, so things don't pile up
- get the things we want integrated into the rest of the notes
- [[close open loops]]
- make it obvious when something has been passed over many times (i.e. should be removed)

The general process:
Do one of the following things with each source:
- remove it: this is the default
- investigate it thoroughly: if it seems worthwhile
- investigate it shallowly, then file it in a reference library
- gets added to some list like "reciped to cook", but importantly not to a list like "to be read"

My currnet default for an inbox is browser tabs. This isn't ideal, but it seems workable with a few extra constrainsts. Initial idea: inbox is one browser window on one computer

There is also an `inbox` folder in this vault, but that doesn't make it easy to see what has been passed over before

The #incomplete tag is also used as an inbox, mostly for epehmeral thoughts.

I don't have a refernce area for shallowly investigated sources, small notes will do for now, maybe with a tag? Let's use `#reference` to denote them, this should also work for in depth notes on specific sources that I want to keep around after I've integrated the material. [[reference tag]]
