# Notes on Information Doesn't Want to Be Free
### By Cory Doctorow

### Foreword(s)

Business as Usual, During Alterations by Ralph Williams
    1950's pulp scifi about a matter replicator, relates to copying of digital media

Lots of other artistic careers are gone, e.g. travelling performers that only need to
ever have 15min of material

Street performers to get paid by everyone that views their performance
Restricting IP like gagging street performers

### Introduction
People make art by default

Cory Doctorow *really* likes writing

### Doctorow's First Law
Any time someone puts a lock on something that belongs to you and won't give you the key,
that lock isn't there for your benefit

Digital locks make it hard to change the media's format. Less important in the
physical world (can't make a dishwasher compatible toaster) but is very important
in the digital space. Think of all the different text-like formats, or image formats

Digital locks reduce copyright protection. It gives power to the org that put the lock on by
locking content to platforms.
Ex. When Amazon wanted a better deal from a (large) publisher they delisted their books. If
circumvention was allowed the publisher could have incentivised users to switch platforms,
but because Amazon added the lock only they were authorized to convert user's current library
to another format

Locks always get broken. We have general purpose computers, not general purpose except for programs
the entertainment industry doesn't like computers.
A full encrypted chain of trust *may* defeat this, at the cost of giving all power to orgs making the 
chain
