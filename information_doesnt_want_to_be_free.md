# Notes on Information Doesn't Want to Be Free
### By Cory Doctorow

### Foreword(s)

Business as Usual, During Alterations by Ralph Williams
    1950's pulp scifi about a matter replicator, relates to copying of digital media

Lots of other artistic careers are gone, e.g. travelling performers that only need to
ever have 15min of material

Street performers to get paid by everyone that views their performance
Restricting IP like gagging street performers

### Introduction
People make art by default

Cory Doctorow *really* likes writing

### Doctorow's First Law
Any time someone puts a lock on something that belongs to you and won't give you the key,
that lock isn't there for your benefit

Digital locks make it hard to change the media's format. Less important in the
physical world (can't make a dishwasher compatible toaster) but is very important
in the digital space. Think of all the different text-like formats, or image formats

Digital locks reduce copyright protection. It gives power to the org that put the lock on by
locking content to platforms.
Ex. When Amazon wanted a better deal from a (large) publisher they delisted their books. If
circumvention was allowed the publisher could have incentivised users to switch platforms,
but because Amazon added the lock only they were authorized to convert user's current library
to another format

Locks always get broken. We have general purpose computers, not general purpose except for programs
the entertainment industry doesn't like computers.
A full encrypted chain of trust *may* defeat this, at the cost of giving all power to orgs making the 
chain, see above

The only way to make a lock is to stop the user from seeing what's going on. The only way to achieve
that is to misrepresent the system state to the user, opening the door for malware etc.

Digital appliances (limited purpose computer, e.g. routers, mp3 players) are general purpose
computers that have been artificially limited. This is OK by itself, but means the device will
treat it's owner as an attacker, complete with spyware etc.
Also limiting - you can mix paint in a blender, but can't do equivalent things with DA

Examples of above: ink-jet printers, large security vulnerabilities; phones, CarrierIQ which
is a commercial rootkit that has access to everything on the phone, including PW and location

Locking out users reduces *sales* not downloads. If you don't sell it how they want they'll pirate
it. Once they pirate it they'll pirate other stuff, and make a habit out of it.

### Doctorow's Second Law
Fame Won't Make You Rich, But You Can't Get Paid Without It

Obscurity is bigger problem for artists than piracy. People have to know your art exists before
they can pay you for it. They might *still* not pay, but at least they have the chance.

It's hard comparing sale with/without piracy. If there's no piracy does the internet still exist,
does top 40 still have influence?

Examples of people, both previously famous and not, that made money without DRM.

Intermediaries control the distribution of media. There used to be a small number of them (blockbuster
decided if your movie would be popular) but the internet made a huge number more. This gave more power
to the content creator as they had more leverage, you could go to new indie online platform or go
it alone.

Big intermediaries fought back. Record labels set terrible terms for music streaming sites, now there
are only a few so they can all be strong-armed into deals (can they really be strong-armed though, I
can't imagine music doing well if it's not on a major platform. Never mind, Spotify would be dead long
before Sony)

*Conversation* is bigger than content. Services where people share media (like twitter or forums) are
also the place where people talk about the media. Going further, a place that is good for talking
about one thing will also become a place for talking about everything.

Word of mouth is the highest recommendation, the internet provides lots of that, see ^.

Corollary: Every medium on the internet is for social conversation first, and anything we do to make
that harder (having to pay...) makes it harder for conversations that turn strangers into paying
customers.

Cost disease: the cost of services goes up as society get richer, regardless of any productivity
increase in performing that service.

*Getting people to pay you:*
 * sell physical copies
 * sell adds. Barrier of entry to getting this set up has gone way down, but so has price of adds
 * sell swag
 * commissions. This is similar to software dev contracting
 * sell tickets. This fits the "copy freely" mentality, the more popular the work the more the tickets
are worth 
 * donations. Again, the more copies the better. Ex: Humble indie bundle, Molly Crabapple

Light bulbs put lamplighters out of work, that doesn't make them immoral. Same goes for the internet

Investors/publishers have expertise, economy of scale and tested workflows. You probably shouldn't go
indie unless you want to put a bunch of non-creative work in.

The internet has a bunch of new intermediaries for things like payment processing and video hosting
etc. This is a good things as we don't want everyone to have to do these things themselves.

Common Carriers: an intermediary that provides services to anyone. This removes liability but comes
more regulation to enforce that the business is in the public interest. Ex a public ferry has more
safety regulations than a private boat, but isn't liable for goods the passengers have. 

Net neutrality comparison with phones: ISPs preferring certain data is comparable to a phone company
charging businesses for "premium" service, otherwise half the calls will be dropped

ISPs have received huge subsidies in the form of rights-of-way (and many others), so start acting 
in the public interest

If you aren't a common carrier you are liable for anything on your network (how does this apply to
ISPs?). This leads to censorship. Ex: Cable companies aren't common carriers, and therefore are
liable for any copyrighted material shown on any channel. This is brutal, so everyone lawyers up
and get insurance. The insurance has no incentive to take risks, so required you to beyond normal
copyright and get permission for things like logos on t-shirts of rioters.

Corollary: strict liability doesn't scale. Ex: Twitter had 6000 tweets/sec, if 1/100 of a % were
infringing on copyright twitter would be liable for > 1BB/min

Notice and take down (NaTD) seems like a happy medium, but everyone involved dislike it. It's a
large (impossible) burden on copyright holders to search everywhere for everything, the hosting
provider has to deal with all the requests and the content creators git hit falsely with no
recourse. It also leads to censorship in the form of fake take-down requests. Examples include
police dept taking down videos of them committing illegal acts etc. See "The Chilling Effects
Clearinghouse"

The entertainment industry pushes for "More intermediary liability, with fewer checks and balance"
in SOPA, PIPA etc.

How are they doing ^:
 * hosting provider: would be liable for infringing content they serve, similar to cable companies
 * linkers: would be liable if they link to an infringing site
 * ISPs: more restrictions, "Three Strikes" etc.
 * search engines: similar to linkers
 * payment processors + ad networks: required to stop payments to *accused* infringers
 * registrars: seize domains
 * DNS: suspend DNS for sites
 * proxies: onion and similar would be illegal
 * tech creators: possibly require licenses for ephemeral copies (i.e. in RAM)
 
Currently much of the above is possible, but requires going through courts/arbitrators.
These would be streamlined, removing much of the oversight and encouraging the intermediaries,
which are private companies, to act as gatekeepers.

Prev point makes it harder for intermediaries, which means less of them and they'll be more
entrenched. This makes it harder and more expensive for content creators as the gatekeepers
have more power. _Disorganized channels are good for creators._

Creator's ability to make a living is tied to two things:
 * negotiation leverage with whoever controls channels to your audience
 * how easy it is for potential customers to discover your work
Increasing intermediaries liability makes this worse.

### Doctorow's Third Law
Information Doesn't Want to Be Free, People Do

The main fight in copyright and the internet isn't about content creators or any company, it's
about a free and open internet.

Copyright has it's place, but that place is with industry not the individual. You wouldn't want
to get the SEC involved when buying a friend lunch.

Associating copying with industry used to work, but with the internet this no longer works. If a
kid doodles some fan fiction it no lawyers should get involved, and this wasn't a problem pre
internet as no one would know, now it's much easier to see the infractions and copyright bots
don't discriminate.

It's impossible to control copying in a similar way to how it is impossible to control lending
money for lunch. This doesn't mean that copyright is dead, in the same way it doesn't mean
financial regulating is dead.

Copyright should be used to regulate industry activity, not cultural.

The internet is making the distribution of wealth in the entertainment industry more even.

A few studies have shown that internet access improves quality of life in almost every way.
Pg 107-108

A censor wall won't work for anything.
 * Requires looking at all traffic, aka spying on everyone
 * Are easy to get around -> have to keep the list of blocked sites secret or it's just
   advertising -> no oversight
