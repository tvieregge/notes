A journal entry by [[David Wen Riccardi-Zhu]]:
>We are often scared of sacrifice, but I have found it to be the most certain path to fulfillment and joy. The reverse is that, if you have a sense of purpose, the consumptive delights become irrelevant. A person with a mission has an internal source of happiness, or has found something more important than their own happiness. For many veterans, the memories that glow aren't the ones of supreme ease or fine dining, but of being in the field, surrounded by friends, working towards a common cause.

> What I would give to make that cause our planet and our future, and to render an entire generation invulnerable to the temptations of luxury, consumption, and status.
