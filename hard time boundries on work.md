I often have thoughts like:

> I've got all day, I'ts fine that I'm not concentrating on work now since I can do work later in the day.

This leads to me wasting time during the day (as in not even doing things I enjoy!) then working late into the evening.

My solution is to have a stricter end time for work, adding some urgency to work.
