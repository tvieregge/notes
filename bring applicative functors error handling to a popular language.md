[[error handling with applicative functors]] is wonderful, but not that many people use [[haskell]] :(

This could be an excellent project to do while taking a sabbatical from [[voltus]]

there's lots of thoughts along this line already, but they tend to be broader in scope (bring the entire concept of applicative functors to a language), so I'm hoping this could be easier. https://varkor.github.io/blog/2018/08/28/feasible-functors-in-rust.html

This is probably going to require thinking about it from a category theory *and* and a programming perspective
