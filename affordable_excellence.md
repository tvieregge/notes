### Medisave
Mandatory medical saving account for the employed
Employees and employers pay percentage of wage into individual's account
Savings can be used for healthcare expenses
Immediate family members may also use the account
Occasional government contributions. Never done regularly, framed as bonus not a normal thing

What is eligible?
    Hospital stays, some outpatient, chronic illness, some diagnostic

### MediShield
Opt out catastrophic illness insurance
Mostly for patients in highly-subsidized hospitals (low income people)
Lifetime maximum
Coinsurance and deductible
Private insurance also available

### Medifund
Safety net
Endowment fund
Money given to healthcare providers to cover patients who cannot afford to pay

### Market Design
both private and public hospitals exist
public hospitals dominate because
    incentive for public hospitals
    subsidies for patients at public hospitals
    high bar for quality at public hospitals
    price control

An early attempt to deregulate public hospitals lead to them compete for affluent clients, resulting in price increases
Controls on public hospitals
    proportion of ward classes, supply of beds and annual budgets are fixed
    approval is required before developing new specialities or getting new expensive equipment

Supply of doctors is regulated

Demand is controlled though co-insurance and deductible rates

Cost of procedures are published by the ministry of health to keep prices in check
Price options are explained at point of care

no price/profit control on prescription drugs, although group procurement is used to keep prices down

Employers must give foreign workers medical insurance

### System design
Most primary care is provided by private clinics
    lower cost are encouraged to be paid for without subsidies
    public clinics also exits for lower income (servers ~20% of pop)

Higher level care is mostly from public hospitals

Shifting to regional system with acute general hospitals linked to rehab centres, home care etc.


### Subsidies
Subsidy rate (%) by ward:
    A   - 0
    B1  - 20
    B2+ - 50%
    B2  - 50-65
    C   - 65-80
    B2 and C are means tested
Q: Are there multiple wards per hospital?

### Funding
Casemix (defining hospital output)
Block grants (fixed amounts)

Continual adjustment: as the pop ages, more funding is being allocated for long term + elder care

Medical tourism is a noticeable source of revenue, and encouraged by the government

Future section ideas:
    supply control
    demand control
    safety net
    funding

### Training and Research
Do it, and do it well
    Need good/motivated doctors
    Helps drive costs down if research is good

### Ageing

Key initiatives:
    allow seniors to stay on the job longer to remain financially independent
    provide friendly transportation
    affordable care
    promote active ageing

community based care for the frail elderly

specific funds set away to pay for health care costs of ageing pop
